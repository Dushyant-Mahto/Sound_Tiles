# Sound_Tiles
Welcome to the Soundful Website! This is a simple web application that allows you to play different musical notes as you hover over various elements on the page. Each note represents a different sound, starting from "do" (C), followed by "re" (D), "mi" (E), "fa" (F), "so" (G), "la" (A), and finally "ti" (B).
